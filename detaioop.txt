● English: System for Retinal Vascular Health Screening
● Vietnamese: Hệ Thống Sàng Lọc Sức Khỏe Mạch Máu Võng Mạc
● Abbreviation: SP26SE025
a. Context:
1. In the era of preventative medicine and personalized healthcare, the early
detection of systemic health risks has become an essential requirement for
enhancing quality of life and reducing the burden of healthcare costs. However,
many serious diseases, particularly those related to cardiovascular, diabetic, and
neurological conditions, often progress silently and are only discovered in their
late stages.
2. Many individuals in Vietnam face barriers in accessing comprehensive, non
invasive, and regular screening methods due to high costs, complex procedures,
or a lack of specialized personnel at the grassroots level. The absence of a fast,
accurate, and widely deployable screening tool presents a significant challenge.
b. Proposed Solutions-The Comprehensive AI Understanding Retinal Analysis (AURA) offers an
integrated approach to enhance early detection and prevention of diseases
through retinal imaging analysis.
+Clinical Decision Support, Not Replacement: AURA acts as a Clinical Decision
Support (CDS) tool that assists — not replaces — physicians. The AI system
analyzes retinal vasculature to detect subtle vascular abnormalities and provide
early diseases risk assessments, enabling doctors to make faster and more
confident decisions.
+Expanding Access to Preventive Care: By connecting to existing fundus cameras
and offering cloud-based analysis, AURA makes advanced vascular screening
available even to community clinics and mid-tier hospitals. This reduces the
need for costly diagnostic infrastructure and helps bring preventive healthcare
to underserved regions.
+Retinal Imaging as a Non-Invasive Health Indicator: The system leverages the
eye as a “window” to systemic health, using retinal vessel morphology to
estimate risks of hypertension, diabetes complications, and stroke —
transforming routine eye exams into a broader tool for disease risk screening.
+Data Collaboration and Continuous Learning: AURA encourages data
partnerships between clinics, hospitals, and research institutions. It begins with
open datasets for model training and evolves through real-world feedback,
strengthening both the AI model and the clinical understanding of vascular
health.
+Ethical, Transparent, and Secure AI Use: All outputs are interpretable and
visually explainable, allowing doctors to validate AI findings. Strict data privacy,
patient anonymization, and compliance with medical regulations ensure safe
and responsible AI adoption.-In essence, AURA delivers a scalable, ethical, and data-driven solution that
empowers healthcare providers to detect cardiovascular risks early, reduce
diagnostic barriers, and improve patient outcomes through AI-assisted retinal
screening.
